                I'm a passionate Fullstack Developer with a strong interest in building things. With hands-on experience in technologies like React, Next.js, and React Native, I enjoy crafting seamless web and mobile applications from front to back.
                <br /><br />
                Programming is my hobby. I find joy in learning new tools, refining my skills, and tackling challenges that help me grow as a developer. Whether it's experimenting with new frameworks or optimizing existing solutions, I'm always driven by curiosity and a desire to improve.
                <br /><br />
                My focus is on continuous improvement and pushing my limits as a developer through hands-on projects and real-world problem solving.                </div>
